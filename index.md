# Credential Registry Publish Action

Credential Engine is now offering a GitHub Action that makes it easy to publish
data to the Credential Registry. The action is available in the
[GitHub Marketplace](#TBD) and may be incorporated in partner organizations'
CI/CD pipelines as new data is published. Publication may be triggered manually,
scheduled to run at regular intervals, or triggered as a step in a larger
workflow immediately following applicable data updates. Use the action as best
fits your organization's needs, and provide feedback to Credential Engine to
help us improve the action.
